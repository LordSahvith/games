# My Games

I am a lover of games, anything from classic arcade games to console/pc or even board games. I love how games stimulate the mind and give the player a sense of accomplishment even for the smallest of tasks.

You'll find that the games in here are based off of tutorials which I will provide links to the sources for anyone interested. I will create the game along with the tutorial but will add some additions of my own as My imagination sparks. Eventually I'll have taken what I've learned from each tutorial and create My own games with the knowledge learned from each and every course/tutorial.

### Utilities

Here are some of the utilities I use to create my games:

* [Udemy] - Learning center for all things tech
* [JavaScript] - I use JavaScript for all my web games
* [C++] - I use C++ for my console games
* [Unreal] - Unreal is free and has a whole arsenal at your disposal.
* [VS Code] - I use VS Code for all my web applications and starting for more advanced projects
* [Visual Studio] - I primarily use this for my console games with Unreal, but VS Code is also capable
* [jQuery] - Just to add a little flavor to the experience
